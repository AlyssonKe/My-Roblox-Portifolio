        "I started a Tower Defense game project to learn new concepts and improve others. I built the core mechanics, such as the placement system, where I used Spring to smooth unit movement. I also had the opportunity to delve deeper into Bezier Curves, which I used to animate arrows indicating the direction from which enemies approach. Additionally, I implemented a three-path upgrade system, targeting priority options (first, last, nearest, farthest, etc), a troop limit, individual unit statistics, status effects (burning, slowing, etc.), enemy waves, and many other systems.",

        "I created this system while looking for a more optimized solution for humanoids, as I was concerned about how having many humanoid units could cause some lag on the server. I tested several methods to optimize this and found a solution where, on the server side, only the HumanoidRootPart is rendered, leaving the visual parts and body to the client side. This prevents the server from becoming too overcharged.",

I also implemented a smooth camera movement system that follows the player's character using the Spring module. Additionally, the match teleport system is robust and optimized. I used modules like Trove to clean up connections after teleportation.",

I also created specific categories for each item type, as well as a skill upgrade system, show selected, equip system, rarity, stackable items and many other systems. All items are stored in an array on the server side, and only the information about the items the player has is sent, preventing explorers from accessing information they shouldn't have and optimizing the networking data sent to clients.",

Each skill was scripted in different modules for organizational reasons and practicality. I created 12 skills initially, but in the video, I showed the 4 that I think are the most interesting. Since each skill behaves differently from the others, I had the opportunity to explore many resources and techniques for each one."

Now, itâ€™s a complete, robust, and optimized system, with features like tools (knife and revolver), roles (murderer, sheriff, innocent), skills, skins, ragdoll, headshot rewards with knife and coin explosion, and more. Since the system requires constant testing with other players, I added an NPC debug feature to test player-related actions, such as killing, effects, ragdoll, etc.",
