                Hello! My name is Alysson. I am 20 years old, and I am a game developer known as Duelan. Currently, I live in Brazil<span className='italic font-bold'>(GMT -3)</span>. I am fluent in Portuguese and have intermediate English skills. I am passionate about creating games on Roblox, and in addition to programming, I enjoy exploring different areas of game development, always looking to learn something new.
                When I am not working on games, I like to spend time with my friends and explore new games. This leisure time not only helps me relax, but also allows me to find new inspirations for my projects.

              <p className="prose text-secondary w-full text-base my-4">
                My journey in game development on Roblox started in 2018, but my passion began well before. At 10 years old, when I received my first computer, I became fascinated with online games and wanted to understand how they are made. In 2017, when I tried Roblox, I noticed the potential of the platform, and in 2018, I immersed myself in development. Since then, I‚Äôve improved my skills by creating various projects, some of which were not released but were essential to my learning. In 2019, I developed <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4237861040/Treacherous-Tower" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-link">Treacherous Tower</a>, where players climb a tower with obstacles that change every 60 seconds. The game surpassed 650 million visits, and it was a milestone in my journey.

                Other major projects include <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/14108196267/The-Adventures-of-John-and-Mark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-link">The Adventures of John and Mark</a>, <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/16497788573/Pink-Palace-Tycoon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-link">Pink Palace Tycoon</a>, and <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/118073417231051/Elemental-Castle-Tycoon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-link">Elemental Castle Tycoon</a>.
                <br/>
                In <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/14108196267/The-Adventures-of-John-and-Mark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-link">The Adventures of John and Mark</a>, I worked alongside my friend <a href="https://x.com/NekoAltz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-link">Neko_Altz</a>. He was responsible for building, modeling, and animation, while I handled programming, VFX, UI, lighting, and creative direction.

                In <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/16497788573/Pink-Palace-Tycoon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-link">Pink Palace Tycoon</a>, I worked with a bigger team, gaining experience in collaboration. I was the main scripter, creating systems such as avatar customization, inventory, missions, shop, tycoon save, and vehicles.

                <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/118073417231051/Elemental-Castle-Tycoon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-link">Elemental Castle Tycoon</a> was a solo project released at the beginning of 2025. A tycoon focused on elemental powers and building castles, where I developed all the programming, building, modeling, and visual effects. Creating it during my vacation allowed me to improve various skills and review important concepts.

              <p className="prose text-secondary w-full text-base my-4">
                In 2025, at 20 years old, I am in the second semester of my Computer Science degree. Although college takes up part of my day, my passion for programming and game development on Roblox stays strong.
                <br/>
                Currently, in my free time, I am developing my most special project, <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/14108196267/The-Adventures-of-John-and-Mark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-link">"Dreams üåô"</a>, which I affectionately call <span className='italic'>"The Project of My Dreams"</span>. Inspired by <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/6516141723/DOORS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-link">"Doors‚Äù</a> by <span className='italic'>LSplash</span>, <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/14108196267/The-Adventures-of-John-and-Mark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-link">"Dreams üåô"</a> blends players' dreams and nightmares with a unique story and essence. Despite being a very complex and ambitious project, I am learning a lot from it, and I have immense affection for every detail in it.
                <br/>
                The game is still in development, and I hope to release it soon. For updates, follow me on my official social media <a href="https://x.com/Duelan_BR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-link">X/Twitter</a>.
